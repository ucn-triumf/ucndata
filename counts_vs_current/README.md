# Draw counts vs current from Li6 detectors

Simulation data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cguGTJseRPwugzmHmRnlhKoFZU4LIulD1Jv2bFTXel0/edit?gid=15994532#gid=15994532).

* Used data from Li6 runs with the following timing scheme:
    * 100 s irradiation
    * 10 s storage
    * 120 s counting
* Background subtraction used nearest background measurement, integrating counts over the same timeframe
* Errors are clearly underestimated from Poissonian statistics only


# Draw single pulse

* Specifically one with zero storage time
