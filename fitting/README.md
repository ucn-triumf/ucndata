# Fitting Routines

The following are shamelessly stolen from the [bfit package](https://github.com/dfujim/bfit) and allow for global fitting as well as fitting with asymmetric errors:

* `global_fitter` ([documentation](https://github.com/dfujim/bfit/wiki/Global-Fitter))
* `leastsquares`
* `minuit` ([documentation](https://github.com/dfujim/bfit/wiki/Minuit))
